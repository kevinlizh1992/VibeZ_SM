# Project VibeZ

    SOEN 341 Social Media Project Winter 2020

## Objective

    Develop a simplified version of Instagram

## Project description

    Using social media may be a frustrating experience. Expressing your true opinion on content posted
    by these "influencers" or even your friends may be a daunting task, and let's be honest, you don't
    want all the attention and hate coming your way from their fans. Introducing VibeZ, the social
    media platform that keeps it 100% real. Is your friend being annoying?
    Do you want to tell them your real opinion but don't want to hurt their feelings? Give them a vibe
    check, and maybe others might just be thinking the same. Is what that influencer says #fact?
    Support them with that vibe check too.
